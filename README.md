T-rex's code
*Reinstate "Caclulate" button*
Second Page: (after calculate button)
if the method is Activity Based:
  Create "n" boxes from range 1 to n asking for the activity in year n for each year. 
  Example: 5 years.
  Activity in year 1:[      ] < Box for user input
  Activity in year 2:[      ] < "
  ...
  Activity in year 5:[      ] < "
  Also: Create a box asking for the total allocation base.
if the method is MACRS:
  Create an option for the user to click either "Half Year Convention" or "Mid Quarter Convention". 
  Preferably a multiple choice, but eh.
